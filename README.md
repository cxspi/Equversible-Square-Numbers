# Equversible-Square-Numbers

### What are they?

Consider 12 and 21, their digits are reversible. Now,

Consider 12^2 and 21^2, 144 and 441 respectively. Notice something? They are reversible. 

This is also true for 13 and 31. 13^2 = 169, 31^2 = 961.

However, that's not true for 14 and 41, use a calculator to check it! 

The question asked now is "what numbers do this and how can you find a pattern?"

### main_calculation.py 

This scipt checks every number from 1 - 10^9, if it satifies the Equversible-Square number condition. 
After then it plots it. A very interesting pattern appears. 

### plot_csv.py 

If you want to test this for yourself, download plot_csv.py and numbers.csv (So you won't have to run the entire calculation yourself)
The plot is set to be in a logarithmic scale as the geometric pattern is far more visible this way.
